# Rethinking

A personal and intricate process of learning statistical rethinking following Richard McElreath. All notes and work done in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) with an R kernel to run the code examples. 

Note that this work is done on a personal basis. Also, most of it is in Dutch because why not make it yourself just a little harder when learning statistics by also adding a lost-in-translation component?[1]

[1] I welcome any suggestions for sensible Dutch translations of "plausibility", "probability" and "likelihood".
